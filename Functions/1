# Exercise 1: Define and Call Simple Functions
# 1. Create a function called greet_user() that prints "Hello, welcome!". Call this function to see the output.
# 2. Write a function greet_user(name) that takes one argument (name) and prints "Hello, [name]!". Call the function with different names to test it.


def greet(name):
    print('Hello,', name)

greet('Jiorge')
