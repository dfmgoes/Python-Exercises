# Exercise 2: Function with Return Values
# 1. Create a function called add_numbers(a, b) that takes two numbers and returns their sum. Call it with different pairs of numbers and print the result.
# 2. Write a function square_number(num) that takes a number and returns its square. Call this function with a few examples.


def add_numbers(a, b):
    return  a + b



def square_number(c):
    return c ** 2


print(add_numbers(19, 94))

print(square_number(5))
