# Exercise 6: Dictionary Lookup
# Write a program that:
# 1. Creates a dictionary, such as grades = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 92, "Charlie": 78}.
# 2. Asks the user to enter a name.
# 3. Tries to retrieve the grade for that name.
# 4. If the name is not in the dictionary, catch the KeyError and print "Name not found."
# 5. If the name is found, print the grade.
grades = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 93, "Charlie": 78}

try:
    name = input('What student?: ')
    print('Result: ', grades[name])

except KeyError: 
    print('Name not found')
