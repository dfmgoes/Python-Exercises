# Exercise 5: Age Checker
# Write a program that:
# 1. Asks the user for their age.
# 2. Tries to convert the input to an integer.
# 3. If there’s a ValueError, print "Invalid input. Please enter a number."
# 4. If the input is valid but the age is negative, raise a custom exception with the message "Age cannot be negative."
# 5. If everything is correct, print a message based on the age, such as "You’re a minor" if under 18, and "You’re an adult" if 18 or older.
try: 

    age = int(input('What is your age?: '))

    if 0 <= age <= 18: 
        print('minor')
    
    elif age > 18:
        print('Major')
    
    else:
        print('Age cannot be negative')

except ValueError:
    print('Invalid Input. Please enter a number ')

#ChatGPT recommends placing negative check first so it does not perform the other checks if true
