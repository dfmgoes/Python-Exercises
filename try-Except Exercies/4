# Exercise 4: List Indexing
# Write a program that:
# 1. Creates a list, such as [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].
# 2. Asks the user to enter an index to access.
# 3. Tries to retrieve the element at that index.
# 4. If there’s an IndexError (index out of range), print "Index is out of range."
# 5. If there’s a ValueError (if the input isn’t a number), print "Please enter a valid index."
# 6. If the index is valid, print the element.
try: 
    list1 = [0, 10, 15, 20, 30]

    index = int(input('Enter the index you want from the list, from 0 to 4'))

    print('Value of the requested index:', list1[index])

except ValueError:
    print('Provide valid numbers')

except IndexError:
    print('Index is out of range')
