# Exercise 3: File Reader
# Write a program that:
# 1. Asks the user for a filename.
# 2. Tries to open and read the file.
# 3. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, catch the FileNotFoundError and print "File not found."
# 4. If the file opens successfully, print its contents.

try: 
    fileq = input('What is the path for the file? ' )
    file = open(fileq, 'r')
    content = file.read()
    print('There are the results of the file:', content)
    file.close()

except FileNotFoundError:
    print('File does not exist')



# try: 
#     fileq = input('What is the path for the file? ')
#     with open(fileq, 'r') as file: # as file - means that it will open it as this variable
#         content = file.read()
#         print('There are the results of the file:', content)

# except FileNotFoundError:
#     print('File does not exist')

# Using "with" to open a file is more Pythonic, as it automatically closes the file when 
# the block exits, even if an error occurs. This makes the code cleaner and safer.
